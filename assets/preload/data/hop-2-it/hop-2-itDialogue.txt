:nate:Randy the rabbit, what the hell are YOU doing in my room?
:nate:Also, where did all of these other people come from?
:randy:I came to hang with you and the Rabbit. Hope you don't mind if I brought a few friends.
:randy:But what is this blue haired brat doing here?
:nate:Hey, be nice! He’s just chilling with me and Beegie.
:randy:Well if y’all are singing, try this tune. It’s one of my old favorites. I had my pal bb remix it. Cool dude.
:nate:Alright, do it Beegie!
:beegiehappy: *Nodding in agreement.*
